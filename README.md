# Project Description
HR-SYSTEM allows employees to hire new people. Employees create and manage vacancies. Also, employees manage applicantsâ€™ requests (create interview results or schedule a technical interview). Guests can see only vacancies. To apply for the selected vacancy guest needs to create an account. After that guest turns into the applicant. Applicant fills applicant request form and applies for the selected vacancy. Then applicant passes several interviews and waits for the results.
